# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create different models and determine which model should be used to predict credit risk. The credit card credit dataset was provided by LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. 

### Description of Analysis
I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.


## Results
